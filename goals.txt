- Make enemy rocket be able to split to avoid being hit by denfender rocket
- Check collision between rockets and buildings, have some sort of punishment system
- Have better visual effects for rockets hitting each other, or other things
- Have sounds
- Implement a system where the enemty rocket is able to run away from the defending rocket
- Add multiple alogorithims of chice for chasing the rocket
I plan to implement a system where every destroyed object gets slowly disiimilated and riped into smaller geometrical pieces.


- Have a smoke trail following the rockets - figure out how to deal with meshes and stuff like that 


- Make the enemey rocket know what it's target is



Allow the rockets to run away from the defender rockets by predicting their movemnet functions and figuring out their tragectory. To avoid too many calculations, do this only when a rocket is close enough to you.


In the end, I guess a clone of command and conquer would be fucking great, almost like a dream.
