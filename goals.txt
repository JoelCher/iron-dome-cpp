- Make enemy rocket be able to split to avoid being hit by denfender rocket
- Check collision between rockets and buildings, have some sort of punishment system
- Have better visual effects for rockets hitting each other, or other things
- Have sounds
- Implement a system where the enemty rocket is able to run away from the defending rocket
- Add multiple alogorithims of chice for chasing the rocket
I plan to implement a system where every destroyed object gets slowly disiimilated and riped into smaller geometrical pieces.


- Have a smoke trail following the rockets - figure out how to deal with meshes and stuff like that 


- Make the enemey rocket know what it's target is
